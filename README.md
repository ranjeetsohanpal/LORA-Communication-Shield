# LoRa_Comm_Mobile
Used for communicating via LoRa through mobiles

This was a project that we were assigned as part of our university curriculum.
The main motivation was to create a communication protocol that would be helpful in the places where WiFi and Cellular networks are not available.
We made use of the ESP32 Bluetooth functionality to send and receive the data stored by esp32 to mobile phones via bluetooth.
The same code can be appliad to two ESP32s and they can be used to communicate with each other.
